# Day 0 - Git and Environment Setup

Today I learned:
-Version control system
-Creating new repo || Connecting the repo with VS code
-Using Git commands:-
        git init:
            -Git initialize
        git status:
            -display the current state of your working directory and the staging area. || identifies which changes are staged for the next commit, which are not, and which files are untracked by Git. 
        git add .: 
            -git → use Git
            add → put changes into the staging area
            . → dot means everything in the current folder
            
            Concept:
                “Git, please prepare ALL current changes so they can be saved in the next commit.”
        git commit -m "Day 0- Git setup nd project structure":
            git → use Git
            commit → create a permanent snapshot
            -m → message flag
            "Day 0- Git setup and project structure" → explanation of the snapshot
            Concept:
            “Save the current staged changes forever, with this message explaining what I did.”
